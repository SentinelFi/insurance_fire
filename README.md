## What We‚Äôre Building

We‚Äôre building a **decentralized fire insurance** on Soroban to bring **automated payouts, transparency, and fairness** to wildfire prone regions where traditional insurances are failing.

Using trusted oracles for wildfire data from satellites and smart contracts for enforcement, we‚Äôre showing how blockchain can turn a slow, opaque process into one that‚Äôs **data-driven and instant**.

> This is a **hackathon MVP**, meant to showcase what‚Äôs possible with our flexible insurance framework‚Äînot a finished product, but a glimpse of what‚Äôs coming.

## Why It Matters

We have family in Northern California, not far from Paradise‚Äîwhere the 2018 wildfire destroyed an entire town. While browsing real estate nearby, we found nearly every property flagged as ‚ÄúExtreme Risk‚Äù with **9/10 Fire Factor‚Ñ¢** and up to **48% wildfire probability** over 30 years.

Here's a map of all active fires in September 2024 in continental US, during the LA fires.

Insurers are pulling out, so even if you wanted to pay high premiums, you may not have a choice. Claims, if covered at all, are slow and frustrating. The system is broken across the board.

The recent case of **Luigi Mangione**, who tragically shot a healthcare executive over a denied claim, had nothing to do with fire insurance‚Äîbut it reflects the **growing anger toward an industry that‚Äôs opaque, adversarial, and outdated**. It‚Äôs clear: insurance across most verticals needs a reset.

## Our Journey so far, and the future

This project builds on our work from a **Kickstarter grant by the Stellar Foundation (Oct 2024)**. That support helped us launch a flight delay insurance POC‚Äîwhere users are paid automatically if their flight is delayed beyond a set threshold.

Our framework is **modular and extensible**‚Äîany team can use it to build insurance products for any vertical, **as long as reliable oracle data exists**. We are building fire insurance in this hackathon to back that claim.

We're applying for the **BUIDL award** with our flight insurance product, where we are **restructuring the framework** to make it more **robust, decentralized and production-ready**, with broader insurance use cases in mind.

We‚Äôre also inviting other builders to build on top of our framework and disrupt the rest of the insurance industry.

## üî• Fire Insurance Architecture ‚Äî ZkTLS and TEE Oracles

To showcase the flexibility of our decentralized insurance framework, we built a wildfire insurance MVP that pays out homeowners automatically when their property is detected to be within a wildfire zone.

### üè° Homeowner Onboarding

- Homeowners provide their **home address** and prove **residency** using the [Reclaim Protocol](https://reclaimprotocol.org/) with a ZK proof (e.g., Amazon order address or Uber usage within the last 6 months).
- The address is converted to **latitude and longitude** using a **geocoding API**.

### üõ∞Ô∏è Fire Detection via Acurast

- The system queries the **NASA FIRMS (Fire Information for Resource Management System) API**, which provides near real-time **satellite-based fire data**.
- A **Node.js script** runs inside an **Acurast Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)** and receives:
  - The coordinates of the homeowner's property.
  - FIRMS satellite fire incident data.
- The script determines if the property is within or near an active fire zone.
- This computation happens inside a TEE to ensure trust and prevent tampering.

This MVP is a real-world example of how our framework supports **on-chain parametric insurance**‚Äîpowered by trusted oracles, automated execution, and secure data validation.

> üì¶ This system enables the creation of scalable, transparent, and automated insurance products across multiple verticals‚Äî_as long as reliable oracle data is available_.

## üß† Soroban Smart Contracts - The Insurance Framework

Our insurance framework is built around a **modular vault system**, inspired by the **ERC-4626 tokenized vault standard** and tailored for **Soroban smart contracts**.

![Vault Architecture](images/architecture.png)

At the core, each insurance market (e.g., wildfire, flight delay) is powered by two vaults:

- **Hedge Vault** ‚Äì Receives premiums from users seeking protection (hedge buyers). They are eligible for payouts when a covered event occurs.
- **Risk Vault** ‚Äì Funded by counterparty investors (risk buyers) who take on the event risk in exchange for yield.

Vaults are deployed and managed using two key contracts:

- **Market Factory Contract**

  - Deploys new pairs of Hedge and Risk Vaults for each insurance market.
  - Enables permissionless creation of custom insurance markets (e.g., wildfire, flood, flight delay).
  - Links each market to its associated controller and oracle feed.

- **Controller Contract**
  - Manages the flow of capital between Hedge and Risk Vaults.
  - Triggers payouts based on verified claim events from oracles.
  - Handles maturity logic, liquidity constraints, and vault state transitions.
  - Ensures all logic is transparent and deterministic.

When a claim condition is met (e.g., fire detected at the insured location), an **Oracle** sends real-world event data to the controller. If validated, the Soroban contract **automatically executes a payout** to the Hedge Vault for the insurance buyers.

## Is this sustainable?

Some might ask: **‚ÄúWhy are traditional insurers not sustainable in high-fire-risk areas, while we are?‚Äù** Traditional carriers often have **high overhead costs** and rely on **middlemen**, making it unprofitable to operate where fire probabilities are elevated. Our **blockchain-based** model, by contrast, is **open-source** and largely **automated**, drastically reducing administrative expenses and conflict resolution overhead.

To illustrate, we ran a **Monte Carlo simulation** with:

- **1,000 properties**
- **\$3,000 annual premium** each
- **\$150,000 claim payout**
- Fire **probability** drawn randomly between **0.3%** and **1.7%**

Through tens of thousands of single-year simulations, the **mean yield**‚Äîi.e., net profit divided by total premiums‚Äîaverages around **40‚Äì50%**. This indicates reliable profitability despite annual fluctuations in fire probability.

However, there is notable **volatility**:

- About 5% of simulations yield as low as **5%**.
- The top 5% exceed **80‚Äì85%**.

Thanks to our low and transparent overhead, we can better withstand higher-risk fire scenarios than traditional insurers. Ultimately, this is still **business**, not charity, but our structure allows us to manage risk where others fail.

## How to Run the Monte Carlo Analysis

We have the analysis script (in Python) in /monte_carlo folder.

1. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment**

```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   (On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate)
```

2. **Install Dependencies**

```
   pip install numpy matplotlib
```

3. **Navigate to the monte_carlo Folder**

```
   cd monte_carlo
```

4. **Run the Program**

```
   python analysis.py
```

This will display a histogram of yield outcomes and print summary statistics (mean yield, 5th percentile, 95th percentile) to the console.

## How to Run the UI locally

```bash
cd ui
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open in web browser: http://localhost:3000/
